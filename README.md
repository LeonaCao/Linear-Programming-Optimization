# Linear-Programming-Optimization

This is a course project in Business Decision Modeling course that I completed with my teammates to solve a linear programming diet arrangement problem using Pyomo in Python.

We were assigned with a menu of a particular restuarant, and then we chose a certain diet (athletic diet) with constraints on several nutritions. Based on the menu and the diet, we were looking for the most appealing optimal solution.
